# Railway Deployment Configuration Complete ✅

## Current Status
Your ScrapeForge is properly configured for Railway deployment:

✅ **Database Connection**: Using `process.env.DATABASE_URL` correctly
✅ **Drizzle ORM**: Configured with Neon serverless PostgreSQL
✅ **Schema**: Up to date with no changes needed
✅ **Build Scripts**: Properly set up for production

## Railway Environment Variables
When you deploy to Railway, ensure these environment variables are set:

### Required:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Railway provides this automatically when you add PostgreSQL
- `NODE_ENV=production`

### Optional:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For enhanced email parsing features

2. Login with GitHub
3. "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"

Railway will automatically:
- Install all dependencies (including Playwright browser support)
