Headless Scraping Activation
(Plak dit letterlijk in Replit chat om headless scraping te activeren met Puppeteer of Playwright, zonder Meta API’s)

🛠️ TASK: Enable Headless Web Scraping for Public Instagram/LinkedIn Profiles (no login required)

🔧 Objective:
Extend ScrapeForge to use headless browser scraping (via Puppeteer or Playwright) instead of relying on APIs.

🔍 Target use case:
Visit public profile or hashtag pages (e.g. https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/astrology/)

Extract public info such as:

Bio

Display name / username

External URL in bio

Email if mentioned

Follower/following count (optional)

Optionally visit visible commenters or followers and extract emails from their bios

✅ Required Implementation:
Scraper Engine Setup

Use Playwright with chromium in stealth mode

No login, no cookies, no personal account

Set custom user-agent to mimic a normal browser

Randomize delays (2–5 sec) between page loads

Retry failed pages up to 2x

Instagram Hashtag Scraping

Input: hashtag or keyword

Navigate to: https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/{hashtag}/

Scroll to load 10–20 posts

For each post:

Click into post

Extract:

Poster username

Bio (via profile page)

External URL (if available)

Email if shown in bio

Optional Deep Scraping

If enabled, collect email data from:

Top commenters on the post

First 5 followers of poster profile

Do not go more than 2 layers deep

Output Integration

Return results into the results table in ScrapeForge

Flag where each email was found (e.g. "user bio", "commenter bio")

Enable export to XLS as usual

Safety & Anti-Ban

Add stealth plugin (playwright-extra-plugin-stealth)

Rotate user agents

Add optional proxy support (env-based)

Limit scraping to max 30 profiles per session

Log warnings if scraping takes longer than expected

UI Update

Add toggle in project config: Use API vs Headless Mode

If Headless Mode is active and platform is Instagram or LinkedIn, use Playwright flow

Show runtime logs in dashboard (e.g. “Scraping profile @xyz...”)
