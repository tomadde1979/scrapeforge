2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Name it `scrapeforge-headless`
4. Set to **Public** (easier for Railway deployment)
5. Click **"Create repository"**
6. Copy the repository URL
7. In Replit Shell, run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/scrapeforge-headless.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## After Connecting to GitHub:
1. Go to **[railway.app](https://railway.app)**
2. Login with GitHub
3. Deploy from your new repository
4. Your headless browser scraping will work immediately!

## Visual Cues to Look For:
- **Git icon** (branching symbol)
- **"Version Control"** text
- **"GitHub"** option
- **"Connect"** or **"Sync"** buttons
- **Branch name** display (usually shows "main" or "master")

The exact location can vary depending on your Replit interface version, but it's definitely there!
