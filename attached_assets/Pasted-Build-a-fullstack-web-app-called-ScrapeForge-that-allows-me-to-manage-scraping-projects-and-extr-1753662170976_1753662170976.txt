Build a fullstack web app called **ScrapeForge** that allows me to manage scraping projects and extract public email addresses from various platforms and websites.

---

üß± TECH STACK:
Frontend:
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (shadcn/ui components)
- Zustand for state management

Backend:
- Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- PostgreSQL (via Neon) using Drizzle ORM
- Puppeteer for headless scraping (extensible per platform)
- OpenAI for AI-enhanced parsing (when needed)

---

üß≠ CORE FEATURES:

1. **Project System**  
   - I can create unlimited "Projects" (e.g. Zodiac Zero, My Bands, Future App X)
   - Each project stores settings independently (platforms, keywords, rate limits, scrape logs)

2. **Platform & Keyword Configuration**  
   - Per project, I can select platforms to scrape (e.g. Instagram, Reddit, LinkedIn, etc.)  
   - Each platform allows me to set keywords, hashtags, or bio phrases to target
   - Allow free input of domains too (for obscure or non-mainstream sites)

3. **Scraping Engine**  
   - Launchable from a ‚ÄúStart Scraping‚Äù button
   - Puppeteer-based scrapers per platform  
   - Scraper looks for public email addresses in:
     - Bio/description fields
     - Link-in-bio URLs (carrd, linktree, beacons, etc.)
     - AI-powered parsing if needed (detect obfuscated email)
   - Show real-time queue progress in UI

4. **Visual Dashboard**  
   - Stats at top (Profiles scanned, Emails found, % with email, AI-parsed)
   - Filterable result list with:
     - Profile name
     - Bio link
     - Email found
     - Platform
     - Export button
   - Download results per project to XLS (using `sheetjs`)

5. **Manual DM Support**  
   - Optional button per profile to copy handle & jump to their platform profile
   - No automation! Just facilitate manual outreach

6. **Admin Interface**  
   - View all scraping logs per project
   - Error tracking per platform
   - Toggle rate limits per platform (to avoid IP bans)

---

üé® UI STYLE:

- Use a clean, minimalist layout like Stripe Dashboard or Notion
- Sidebar for navigation: Dashboard, Projects, Settings
- Light theme
- Icons via FontAwesome

---

üöÄ SCALABILITY:

- Scrapers should be modular per platform
- Each platform's scraper = separate file with same function signature
- AI email detection should be an optional fallback per profile (use OpenAI for fuzzy detection)

---

‚ö†Ô∏è LEGAL & SAFETY REMINDERS:

- Scrape only public information
- Don‚Äôt store passwords, session cookies or private login credentials
- Never send automated DMs ‚Äî only manual message options
- Include a disclaimer in settings page: "Use responsibly. Only collect publicly visible data."

---

Start from scratch. Set up the file structure cleanly. Let me know what is scaffolded already and what is still pending. Use the name `ScrapeForge` for the app.
