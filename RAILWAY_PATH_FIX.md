# Railway Path Resolution Fix

## Issue Identified
The deployment crash with `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined` is caused by:

1. `import.meta.dirname` being undefined in Railway's Node.js environment
2. Path resolution in `server/vite.ts` line 71: `path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "public")`

## Root Cause
Railway's bundling environment doesn't properly support `import.meta.dirname` in production builds, causing the path to be undefined.

## Solution Applied
Modified the build configuration to ensure proper path resolution in production:

### Build Script Update
- Updated build script to use relative paths compatible with Railway
- Ensured `dist/public` directory structure matches expected paths
- Fixed static file serving for production deployment

### Environment Variables Check
- DATABASE_URL: ✅ Properly configured
- NODE_ENV: ✅ Set to "production" 
- PORT: ✅ Uses Railway's provided port

## Railway Deployment Steps:
1. Upload project to GitHub repository
2. Deploy to Railway from GitHub
3. Add PostgreSQL service
4. Railway will automatically provide DATABASE_URL
5. Static files will be served from correct `dist/public` path

## Expected Result
- ❌ Path resolution crash → ✅ Proper static file serving
- ❌ 500 errors → ✅ Working API endpoints
- ❌ Failed database connection → ✅ PostgreSQL connectivity

The path resolution issue is now fixed for Railway deployment.
