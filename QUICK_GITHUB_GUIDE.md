# Find GitHub Connection in Replit - Visual Guide

## Where to Look (Most Likely Locations):

### 1. Left Sidebar Icons
Look for these specific icons in your left sidebar:
- **Git branch icon** (looks like a Y or tree branch)
- **GitHub logo** (cat icon)
- **Version control icon** (branching symbol)
- **"Tools" section** with Git options

### 2. Top Menu Areas
- **File menu** → Git options
- **Tools menu** → Version Control
- **View menu** → Git panels

### 3. Project Settings
- **Settings gear icon** → Git/GitHub integration
- **Three dots menu** (⋯) → Version Control

### 4. Command Palette
- Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** (or Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
- Type "git" or "github"
- Look for "Connect to GitHub" options

### 5. Files Panel
- Right-click in the file explorer
- Look for Git or GitHub options in context menu

## What You're Looking For:
- Button saying **"Connect to GitHub"**
- Option to **"Create repository"**
- **"Sync with GitHub"** or similar
- Any mention of **"Version Control"**

## Once You Find It:
1. Click "Connect to GitHub"
2. Choose "Create new repository" 
3. Name it `scrapeforge-headless`
4. Set to Public
5. Create repository

## Backup Plan:
If you still can't find it after checking these locations, the manual upload method (download zip → extract → upload to GitHub) will work perfectly for deploying to Railway.

Your ScrapeForge is ready either way!
