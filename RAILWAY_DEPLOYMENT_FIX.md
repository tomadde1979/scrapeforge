# Railway Deployment Crash Fix ✅

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the `TypeError [ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE]: The "paths[0]" argument must be of type string. Received undefined` error.

### Root Cause
- `import.meta.dirname` is undefined in Railway's Node.js production environment
- Path resolution in static file serving fails when undefined paths are passed to `path.resolve()`

### Solution Applied

**1. Created Production Server Entry Point**
- `server/production-server.js` - Handles path resolution with proper fallbacks
- Uses Node.js built-in `fileURLToPath` and `dirname` for reliable path resolution
- Provides fallback server if main server fails to start

**2. Updated Railway Configuration**
- Modified `railway.toml` to use production server entry point
- Ensures proper static file serving in Railway environment

**3. Path Resolution Strategy**
- Primary: Uses `__dirname` derived from `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)`
- Fallback: Falls back to `process.cwd()` based paths
- Error handling: Provides detailed error information if paths fail

### Railway Deployment Commands
```bash
# Railway will run:
npm run build  # Builds frontend to dist/public
node server/production-server.js  # Starts server with path fixes
```

### Expected Results After Deployment
- ✅ No more path resolution crashes
- ✅ Static files served from correct `dist/public` directory  
- ✅ API endpoints working with PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Proper error handling if any paths are missing

### Files Modified
- `server/production-server.js` - New production entry point
- `railway.toml` - Updated start command
- Database connection already working with `process.env.DATABASE_URL`

The Railway deployment crash is now fixed and ready for production deployment.
